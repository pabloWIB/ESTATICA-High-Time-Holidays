1. I need a landing page for a travel company dealing with holidays and tours.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here’s an idea for the layout:

- **Welcome Section**: A big, bold image of a top destination with a short and sweet intro.

- **Tour Highlights**: A few key tours or holiday packages with cool descriptions and prices.

- **Traveler Reviews**: Real stories or quotes from people who’ve had a great time.

- **Why Travel with Us?**: A little section about what makes your company the best choice for holiday planning.

- **Footer**: Contact info and links to your social media so people can follow and stay in touch.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. I'm looking at a page which will feature travel packages in India and Maldives mainly with a general coverage of other 
worldwide locations too. The name of the company will be High Time Holidays. Will need a contact box / chat box if possible 
on top. Rest as you mentioned. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

India and Maldives as the focus, worldwide options, plus a contact/chat box on top.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Travel and tourism aimed at selling holiday packages
2. You know better, I think
3. Sell fully inclusive holiday packages for Maldives, Kerala (in India) and other locations
4. Blue, green should be nice
5.
